Chose the red pill
An unexpected journey 
So begins a new path on this journey called life, leaving the fresh green leaves of the Universe for a trip down the rabbit hole and unearthing the realm of Software Development
The first part of my journey begins with Umuzi, having joined them on their bootcamp focusing on Web Development using JavaScript
